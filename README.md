# MockData api


# Node express get data

## You need an api key to access endpoints
example: http://localhost:5500/inclusionMetrics?apiKey=<get a key> <br>
you can get the key from contacting me
(I know very simple)

### If api key would be wrong you will get an error like so:
 
```
{
    "message": "unouthorized, no valid api key",
    "code": 401
}

```
